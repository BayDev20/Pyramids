# Interactive 3D Pyramids with WebGL

This project is an interactive 3D visualization of pyramids, built using **WebGL**. Users can manipulate the view by zooming in and out using a slider. The scene includes pyramids rendered in different colors using the **Painter's Algorithm** for depth sorting. The project also utilizes **gl-matrix** for handling matrix transformations, ensuring that the pyramids' positions and perspectives are accurately rendered.

## Features

- **3D Pyramids**: Three pyramids rendered using WebGL, each with different colors: cyan, magenta, and yellow.
- **Interactive Zoom**: The user can zoom in and out of the scene with a slider control.
- **Painter's Algorithm**: The pyramids are rendered using the Painter's Algorithm, ensuring correct depth sorting based on the camera's position.
- **Responsive Interface**: The design is clean, modern, and responsive, with a dark theme and soft blue accents.
- **WebGL Canvas**: The scene is rendered within a `<canvas>` element using WebGL.
